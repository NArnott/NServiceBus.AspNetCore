## Overview

This package provides a common framework for adding NServiceBus to AspNetCore applications. It adds various services to IServiceCollection to make accessing NServiceBus inside your AspNetCore controllers really easy. It also automatically wires up all your services into NServiceBus as well so you can inject them into NSB Message Handlers.

## Usage
